# RBAC Admin Dashboard

## Overview

This project is a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Admin Dashboard built with React.js. It provides an interface for managing users, roles, and permissions. The dashboard includes user management, role management, and dynamic permission assignments. It also includes placeholders for a backend API.

## Features

1. **User Management**: View, add, edit, and delete users. Assign roles to users and manage their status (Active/Inactive).
2. **Role Management**: Define and edit roles. Assign permissions to roles and manage custom attributes.
3. **Dynamic Permissions**: Assign or modify permissions for roles with a clear display for easy understanding.
4. **Responsive Design**: The UI is designed to be responsive and works well on different devices and screen sizes.
5. **Mock API**: Simulate server responses for CRUD operations on users and roles (optional).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rbac-admin-dashboard.git
    cd rbac-admin-dashboard
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the development server**:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

2. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Project Structure

- `src/components`:
    - `Header.js`: Contains the logo and navigation links.
    - `Sidebar.js`: Contains links to different sections of the admin dashboard.
    - `Dashboard.js`: Main landing page of the dashboard.
    - `UserManagement.js`: Component for managing users.
    - `RoleManagement.js`: Component for managing roles.

## API Simulation

If you choose to implement the optional custom API simulation, you can use JSON Server to mock API calls.

1. **Install JSON Server**:
    ```sh
    npm install -g json-server
    ```

2. **Create a `db.json` file** with sample data for users and roles:
    ```json
    {
      "users": [
        { "id": 1, "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com", "role": "Admin", "status": "Active" },
        { "id": 2, "name": "Jane Smith", "email": "jane@example.com", "role": "User", "status": "Inactive" }
      ],
      "roles": [
        { "id": 1, "name": "Admin", "permissions": ["Read", "Write", "Delete"] },
        { "id": 2, "name": "User", "permissions": ["Read"] }
      ]
    }
    ```

3. **Start the JSON Server**:
    ```sh
    json-server --watch db.json --port 5000
    ```

4. **Update API endpoints** in your components to use the mock server (e.g., replace `/api/users` with `http://localhost:5000/users`).
